# Hybrid Network Topology using Scilab

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Hybrid Network Topology
by combining Star, Ring, and Tree topologies using Scilab.

## Aim
To design and visualize a hybrid network topology that improves scalability,
reliability, and efficient communication.

## Description
The hybrid topology integrates:
- Star topology for centralized control
- Ring topology for continuous data flow
- Tree topology for hierarchical expansion

This combination is commonly used in real-world networks such as airports,
campuses, and smart city infrastructures.

## Files Included
- hybrid_topo.sce : Scilab source code for hybrid topology
- README.md : Project description
- outputs/ : Screenshots of the generated topology output

## How to Run
1. Open Scilab
2. Execute the following command:
   exec('hybrid_topo.sce');

## Output
The outputs folder contains screenshots showing the
visual representation of the hybrid network topology.
